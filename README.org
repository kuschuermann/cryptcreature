** Introduction
   CryptCreature provides you with an interactive way to explore
   cryptography: Pick an algorithm, mode, and padding; create a random
   key of different sizes, load a key from disk, and save it for
   later; watch the cipher text change as you type; see at hand of a
   visual image why ECB mode is so bad. More importantly, learn from
   the wealth of information provided by the program’s popup tool
   tips, and if you like reading source code, well that’s in there,
   too!
